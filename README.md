# Vandermonde Neural Operators

We have renamed our method to **Discrete Spectral Evaluations for Neural Operators** with the paper available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19663). The new codebase is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/camlab-ethz/DSE-for-NeuralOperators/tree/main). 

We have added a submodule pointing to the new repository here, but will work on the new repository moving forward.
